This repository contains my implementation of the push_swap project from the 42 cursus. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations, aiming for the smallest number of moves.

## About

The project push_swap is a sorting algorithm challenge. Given a stack of unique integers (stack_a), the goal is to sort it in ascending order. To do this, you can only use a specific set of operations and a second, initially empty stack (stack_b). The program must output the shortest sequence of operations that sorts the stack.

The allowed operations are:

    `sa, sb, ss`: Swap the first two elements of stack a, stack b, or both.

    `pa, pb`: Push the top element from one stack to the top of the other.

    `ra, rb, rr`: Rotate the stack up (the first element becomes the last).

    `rra, rrb, rrr`: Reverse rotate the stack down (the last element becomes the first).

## Structure

The core of the project is to find an efficient sorting algorithm that minimizes the number of operations. My approach is divided based on the size of the stack:
#### 1. Input Handling

    The program first validates the input to ensure all arguments are unique integers within the int range. It can handle numbers passed as multiple arguments or as a single space-separated string.

#### 2. Indexing

    Before sorting, each number in stack_a is assigned an index based on its final sorted position. The smallest number gets index 0, the next smallest gets index 1, and so on. This simplifies the sorting logic, as the goal becomes ordering the nodes by their index.

#### 3. Sorting Algorithms

    Simple Sort (for 2 to 5 numbers): For very small stacks, specific, hard-coded sequences of moves are used to sort them optimally. For example, sorting three numbers can be done in a maximum of two moves.

    Large Sort (for more than 5 numbers): A more complex algorithm is used for larger stacks. It's a variation of a radix sort or "Turk" algorithm:

        1. Push the first two elements from stack_a to stack_b to start.

        2. For each subsequent element in stack_a, calculate the cheapest number of moves required to push it to stack_b and place it in the correct sorted position there. This involves analyzing different combinations of rotate (ra, rb) and reverse rotate (rra, rrb) operations.

        3. Once all but three elements are in stack_b, sort the remaining three in stack_a.

        4. Push all elements from stack_b back to stack_a in the correct order.

        5. Finally, rotate stack_a until the smallest element is at the top.

## Bonus

The bonus part consists of a second program called checker. This program takes the same list of numbers as an argument, but then reads a sequence of operations from the standard input.

    It applies these operations to the initial stack.

    After reading all operations, it checks if stack_a is sorted and stack_b is empty.

    It prints OK if the stack is correctly sorted, and KO otherwise.

This is useful for verifying that the sequence of moves generated by push_swap is correct.

```
$> ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
OK
```

## Requirements

To compile and run this project, you will need:

    A C compiler, such as gcc.

    The make utility.

    My custom libft library is included as a submodule.

## Instructions
#### 1. Compile the project

To compile the push_swap program, clone the repository and run:
$ make

To compile the checker bonus program:
$ make bonus

The Makefile will automatically compile the included libft library first.
#### 2. Clean files

To remove the object files (.o):
$ make clean

To remove object files and the executables (push_swap, checker):
$ make fclean

To clean and recompile everything:
$ make re
#### 3. How to run

Run push_swap with a list of numbers as arguments:
```
$ ./push_swap 2 1 5 3 4
```

You can also use a single string of space-separated numbers:
$ ./push_swap "2 1 5 3 4"
